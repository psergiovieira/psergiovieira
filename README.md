## About Me

I'm a software developer with several years of experience working with a wide range of tools, technologies, and processes. I consider myself agnostic about technology, which means I'm open to using whatever tools are best for solving a particular problem.

My focus is on improving the software development life cycle, from design to deployment. I'm passionate about finding ways to make development faster, more efficient, and more enjoyable. 

In particular, I'm a huge enthusiast of agile and DevOps culture. I believe that these methodologies are essential for delivering high-quality software in a timely and efficient manner. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a full-stack developer at Duck Creek Technologies in a collaborative, autonomous, and cross-functional team with a huge focus on usability, high availability, low latency, and scalability. 
Recently I'm working more often with ReactJS, Typescript, .Net Core, Jest, Playwright and Azure DevOps.
